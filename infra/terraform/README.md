# Space SRE Lab – Terraform EKS Environment

This folder contains the Terraform configuration for the **Space SRE Lab** AWS environment.  
It is designed as a **learning-focused EKS lab**, not as production infrastructure.

The goal is to demonstrate how I would model:

- A VPC with private subnets across multiple AZs  
- An EKS cluster with a managed node group  
- IAM roles for the EKS control plane and worker nodes  
- Clean module boundaries between **network** and **cluster**  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### **VPC**
- CIDR: `10.42.0.0/16`
- Two private subnets (AZ-a and AZ-b)

### **EKS Cluster**
- Kubernetes version: configurable (default `1.35`)
- Managed node group (t3.medium, 2–4 nodes)
- IAM roles for:
  - `eks_cluster_role`
  - `eks_node_role`

### **Terraform Outputs**
- VPC ID  
- Private subnet IDs  
- EKS cluster name  
- Cluster endpoint  
- Certificate authority data  
- Node group name

## ⚠️ Network Model Scope

The Terraform network module intentionally focuses on the VPC, private subnets, and EKS module boundaries used for architecture discussion.

It does not currently provision production egress components such as NAT gateways, Internet gateways, route tables, or VPC endpoints. A deployable private EKS environment would require the appropriate connectivity design for node bootstrap, image retrieval, AWS API access, and other outbound dependencies.

This keeps the repository non-destructive and focused on infrastructure modeling rather than representing the Terraform configuration as a production-ready AWS environment.

## 🧪 Usage (Safe Lab Mode)

This lab is **not meant to be applied by default**.  
It exists to demonstrate how I structure Terraform for AWS/EKS and to support technical discussions during interviews.  
All examples below operate in **non-destructive “plan-only” mode**, ensuring no AWS resources are created.

You can safely run the following Terraform commands:

```bash
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars.example"
```

> These commands help validate the structure, variables, and module wiring of the
> lab environment without provisioning any infrastructure. This is the recommended
> mode for interview review and exploration.
